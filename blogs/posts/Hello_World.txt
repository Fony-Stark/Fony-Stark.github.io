Welcome to the blog-subpage of this website. Here you will be able to see some of my undergoing projects and my considerations about them.
I'll also try to add links as reference on subjects I find interesting. 

There are two types of chets in here, blogs and posts, blogs are a link with a title in blue, which you can click in on to see more under the same topic.
A post is just a single text message. It title head will be written in black.

The sorting of the blogs and posts are that blogs are always ontop of posts, the only exception to this rule, is this post, being a greeting as it is :). And disnewer, a blog or post is, discloser to the top it is.
